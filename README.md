# Facial-classification-using-CNN-and-MATLAB-according-to-gender
This code trains a CNN using a collection of facial images that are cropped and aligned. Verification with new images gives an accuracy of 91%
The training Dataset was originally from UTKFace was split according to the two genders using a custom MATLAB script. Having the dataset split into appropriate folders makes it easier to use MATLAB's imagedatastore in training and verification
